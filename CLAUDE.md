# Virtual Closet (wardrobe-v3)

Photorealistic virtual try-on with a persistent personal avatar. Single-user, local-first.
Working code in `virtual-closet/`; plan in `virtual-closet-execution-plan.md`; running
decisions in `virtual-closet/docs/decisions.md` (read it — it carries the standing rules).

## Current state (2026-07-14, evening)

- Phases 0–4 complete. **avatar-v3 is canon** (2026-07-14): user-supplied 4-pose library
  in `avatar/avatar-v3/` (front / contrapposto / hand-on-hip / 34turn) — new lineage
  superseding avatar-v1 (v1 4-view sheet kept in `avatar/avatar-v1/`). **Whole catalog
  re-rendered on v3 poses 07-14** (`tryon.py --pose <name>`, works for `--outfit` too;
  v1 renders legacy on disk, old look renders in hidden.json). Pose map: 01
  contrapposto, 02 hand-on-hip, 03 front (Janice rejected its drifted contrapposto —
  hidden via hidden.json, which now also governs cutout choice in the server AND
  cutout_render.py), 04 34turn, 05 front, look 01+02 34turn, look 01+02+04 hand-on-hip.
  One pose per saved look; difficulty-4/5 garments stay on front. **Poses are
  archive-only (Janice 07-14): the fitting room shows/corrects front renders exclusively**
  (server filters pose-tagged stems from `renders`). Front v3 renders exist for all five
  garments (01–04 batch $0.235, approved 07-14; 02 corrected twice via the feedback
  loop — navy→pure black, then waistband removed → `02-jeans_nb2_v3_4.png`).
  **Lesson (07-14): chained correctives compound face drift** — two stacked nb2 edits
  made 02's face uncanny despite face-swaps (each edit re-synthesizes the head; swap
  restores identity, not skin texture). Batch fixes into ONE corrective note when
  possible; after edits degrade a face, transplant the head from the cleanest render
  of the same chain locally ($0, alignment is pixel-close) → `02-jeans_nb2_v3_5.png`.
  05's front render was frame-padded locally to square 1824² to match the 1024² v3
  renders (nb2 returned a 1:3 sliver; original at `renders/archive/*_prepad.png` —
  `renders/archive/` is app-invisible).
- Phase 3 benchmark done (`docs/phase3-benchmark.md`): default try-on pipeline is
  **fal-ai/nano-banana-2/edit + fal-ai/face-swap finish** ($0.059/render). NB Pro is worse
  at try-on (re-stages scenes); IDM-VTON needs its `category` param wired.
- Server `scripts/closet_server.py` → http://localhost:8765 (run with
  `ENABLE_GENERATION=1` for live spending). Single-item try-on, multi-item outfit compose,
  feedback→corrective-edit loop, clear-to-base, look save/publish/delete
  (`/api/looks`, `/api/looks/delete`, `/api/publish`) — all working from the UI.
- **One brand ("the archive."), two views, one SYVE language** (white void, black 1px
  hairlines, uppercase Helvetica, italic lowercase wordmark):
  - `/` — **SYVE-style carousel** (`app/carousel.html`, single-file): figure cutouts
    (from `scripts/cutout_render.py`, rembg u2net_human_seg), spec-faithful slot
    interpolation + infinite wrap + 80px snap/dwell, x-axis scroll + click-to-center,
    TRY ON wired to the live pipeline; hero slot at 85% of spec size (Janice: full size
    too big); snap ease slowed to 0.08 (07-14); hero click opens the detail overlay
    (brand headline for garments, item rows + pose for looks, OPEN IN FITTING ROOM as
    the black primary — no TRY ON button there). Spec: `virtual-closet/design-inspo/`
    (docx + reel).
    A **runway-procession variant** (single-file line receding to a vanishing point, per
    `design-inspo/runway-inspo.avif`) was built and shelved same night — saved at tag
    `runway-procession-v1` (restore: `git checkout runway-procession-v1 -- virtual-closet/app/carousel.html`).
    An **auto-scroll variant** (ambient drift + hover slow-to-crawl) was built and shelved
    2026-07-14 — saved at tag `auto-drift-v1` (restore:
    `git checkout auto-drift-v1 -- virtual-closet/app/carousel.html`).
  - `/fitting-room` (`/classic` kept as alias) — **fitting room** (outfit rail | stage |
    racks). Design lineage: Boutique v3 (313NY, tag `boutique-v3`; amber rejected as
    masculine, violet/rose rejected outright) → SYVE restyle 07-13 (tag
    `fitting-room-syve-v1`) → **prettier pass 07-14** (current): mirror stage + gallery
    label, text-first index racks with hover preview, manifest outfit rail, "Nº 313"
    copy removed.
  - `renders/hidden.json` — render stems the server keeps out of the app (files stay on
    disk). Size row reads `size_owned` from each garment's `meta.json`; unset = no
    highlight (log real sizes at ingest — not everything is S).
- **Two-view architecture BUILT (2026-07-14, user-approved):** home = archive (`/`);
  fitting room at `/fitting-room` (`/classic` alias). The **look is the atom**:
  `looks.json` is the canonical store (draft → published lifecycle; see decisions.md).
  Doors: archive hero click → detail overlay (items+sizes, pose, re-render, OPEN IN
  FITTING ROOM → localStorage handoff into slots); fitting room SAVE LOOK = free draft,
  PUBLISH = pose-picker + $0.06 render + cutout → appears in carousel. Cross-document
  view transitions morph the hero ↔ stage (`view-transition-name: figure`) — polished
  07-14: 0.55s soft-ease morph over a 0.35s root crossfade; the detail overlay's image
  anchors the morph while open; plain header links clear the names (quiet crossfade,
  morphs reserved for the deliberate doors). Publishing runs the cutout pass via the
  liminal venv subprocess. Poses remain archive-only,
  no exceptions (Janice 07-14): looks arriving via OPEN IN FITTING ROOM load the slots
  and show the base avatar. **Prettier pass shipped 07-14** (mirror stage + gallery
  label, text-first index racks with hover preview, manifest outfit rail — see
  decisions.md); pre-pass design tagged **`fitting-room-syve-v1`**
  (revert: `git checkout fitting-room-syve-v1 -- virtual-closet/app/`). Garment `meta.json` has a `brand` field (all five
  filled — Peachy Den / In This Era / Nin Studio / Musinsa Standard / Woodrose Deli),
  shown as the first line of the archive detail overlay; fill at ingest for new items.
- Spend: ~$6.35 of $25 cap (`python3 scripts/genlog.py summary`). Includes Janice's own
  first live loop 07-14 (published+removed a 02+03 look, one 01 re-render, $0.118 — the
  publish pipeline's first real end-to-end validation).

## Standing rules

1. **Spending:** fal calls only in user-approved batches/envelopes. All calls go through
   `scripts/genlog.py` budget gate; never bypass it.
2. **Identity:** every render with a visible avatar face gets a `fal-ai/face-swap`
   finishing pass, source `avatar/avatar-v3/front.png` (v3 canon 2026-07-14; v1 renders
   are legacy lineage). Never edit the avatar's head region with NB models (edits collage
   or regress the face — regenerate instead).
3. **Prompts for nb2/edit must be neutrally worded** ("virtual try-on: show the person
   wearing…", never "dress the woman", no body-size adjectives) — its content checker is
   strict. Anti-collage phrasing ("one single figure, not a collage…") in every prompt.
4. **Renders:** `renders/<garment>_<arm>_v3[_<pose>]_<n>.png` (v1 = legacy lineage);
   look renders `outfit_<nums>[_<pose>]_<n>.png`; `_raw` = pre-swap intermediate
   (excluded from the app). Garment-id prefix is how the app matches renders;
   `renders/hidden.json` hides stems from render lists AND cutout choice;
   `renders/archive/` is app-invisible.

## Key commands

```bash
ENABLE_GENERATION=1 python3 scripts/closet_server.py     # app (from virtual-closet/)
python3 scripts/tryon.py <garment-id>                    # one try-on render
python3 scripts/tryon.py <gid> --pose contrapposto       # render on an avatar-v3 pose base
python3 scripts/tryon.py --outfit 01-plain-tee 02-jeans  # multi-item compose
python3 scripts/tryon.py <gid> --correct "wrong fit" --note "…"  # corrective edit
python3 scripts/genlog.py summary                        # spend vs cap
/Users/janice.chang/liminal-wardrobe/.venv/bin/python scripts/extract_garment.py  # cloth-seg cutouts
```

The liminal-wardrobe venv (Python 3.9) has rembg/cv2/PIL; system python3 is 3.9 (no
`str | None` syntax). Headless design QA: Chrome `--headless=new --screenshot=…` then
actually look at the PNG.

## Queued next (do not build until asked)

- **ASCII entrance page (spec agreed 07-14, wait for Janice's baseline inspo image):**
  overlay skin inside `carousel.html` — a figure/wordmark rendered as a luminance-mapped
  monospace glyph grid on canvas, black on the white void; slow shimmer at rest;
  "enter the archive." click → medium-speed dissolve (ideally resolving into the real
  hero figure); shows once per browser session (sessionStorage). $0, pure front-end.

- **Look cards, remaining half:** the content-unit half shipped with publish (rembg
  cutout → cleanup → crop, per CARD-PIPELINE). Still queued: a dense **grid/index view**
  of all looks (second lens beside the carousel) once the archive grows past ~10 looks,
  plus any coverflow treatment from `~/liminal-wardrobe-v2/spec/design/CARD-PIPELINE.md`.
- **Pose rollout DONE** (see current state) — going forward: assign one pose per saved
  look at creation (~$0.06/render). Do NOT re-pose via nb2/edit prompt language alone
  (it's an editor; re-posing fights it). Difficulty-4/5 garments stay on the front pose
  (03 plissé AND 05 draped maxi — check `difficulty` in meta.json, not folder names;
  03's drifted contrapposto rejected by Janice 07-14, hidden not deleted).
- **New garment ingest incoming:** Janice will provide new on-model photos at a later
  session. At ingest, fill `meta.json` per the schema **including `size_owned`** (sizes
  vary per item — never default to S), **`brand`** (shown in the archive detail overlay),
  and the per-item note on what in the photo is NOT part of the garment.
